Speciality Distribution
=======================

Speciality Distribution for TYPO3 CMS.

Motivation
----------

All started with the modernisation of our Dummy package we were using in our company. To give a bit of background, we were aiming to:

* Have Twitter Bootstrap as HTML / CSS Framework
* Use as much as possible Fluid for the rendering and the templating. Actually, it turned out we have reached the 100% thanks to the work of Claus Due
* Keep folder fileadmin clean from TS / JS / CSS files which should be for storing media only (images, documents etcâ€¦)

We wanted not only a package to demonstrate the capability of TYPO3 but also something useful so that it should save us from the tedious
and repeating work when kick-starting a website. The result is pretty much promising.
More important we **have put everything in public** so that you can test and also take advantage for your own needs.
