Generate SQL export
===================

There is a utility command for generating a SQL dump ready for the import. 
The command will generate a SQL dump file in EXT:speciality_distribution/ext_tables_static+adt.sql::

	# Replace "./typo3cms" by "./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase distribution:export" if typo3_console is not installed
	./typo3cms distribution:export
